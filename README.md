Dependencies
------------
- usearch
- mafft
- BioExt
- others?

Installation
------------
Still need to write a Makefile.

For now, make scripts available on the PATH.

Also, change path to references in strandCaller. (TODO: make this more
portable).

TODO: should we add references to repo, or include script to download
them?

Usage
-----
Run the whole pipeline with `processEnv`.
